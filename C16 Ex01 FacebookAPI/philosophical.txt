The unexamined life is not worth living
Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent
Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily
The life of man (in a state of nature) is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short
I think therefore I am (Cogito, ergo sum)
He who thinks great thoughts, often makes great errors
We live in the best of all possible worlds
What is rational is actual and what is actual is rational
God is dead! He remains dead! And we have killed him.
There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide
