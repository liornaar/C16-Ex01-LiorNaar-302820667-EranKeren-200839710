It always seems impossible until its done.
Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. 'Til your good is better and your better is best. 
We should not give up and we should not allow the problem to defeat us. 
In order to succeed, we must first believe that we can. 
Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough. 
Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. 
A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others.
What you do today can improve all your tomorrows.
